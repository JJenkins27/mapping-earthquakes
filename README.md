# Earthquake Mapping

Using JavaScript, Mapbox Leaflet.js, D3, HTML, and geoJSON API data to map earthquakes within the last 7 days

## Overview of Project

Information gathered from earthquake.usgs.gov for all earthquakes within the last 7 days. Results published via world map to a website using Leaflet.js.

### Purpose

Build insightful data visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. With earthquakes maps that are informative and easy to use, the visualation may be used by the Disaster Reporting Network, reporters, and other users interested in the data.

## Results

Interactive map created which details earthquake data within the last 7 days. In the upper right hand corner, user is able to select 3 different map styles (Streets view, Satellite, and Dark) and toggle 3 different layers (All earthquakes, tectonic plates, and major earthquakes) depending on the data they want to see. The webpage speaks directly to the usgs.gov website so as there are new earthquakes, the data will appear once the webpage is refreshed.

Below are some ways in which the users can interact with the map:
